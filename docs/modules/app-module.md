# Application Module

The Application Module is a built-in module which is added by default to each new application you create with the Builder.

Each Application Module delivers the [App Layout]({% slug applayout_kuib %}), [Landing Page]({% slug landingpage_kuib %}), [Login]({% slug login_kuib %}), and [Unauthorized Page]({% slug unauthorized_kuib %}) system views.

> The Application Module cannot be deleted and does not provide options for setting user roles.
