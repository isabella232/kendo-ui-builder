# Modules Overview

Modules are the functional units of the web application and represent collections of views.

* [Common modules]({% slug settingsmodules_kuib %}) can be added, modified, or removed and provide options for adding and editing views within each module while you design the web application.
* [Application Module]({% slug appmodule_kuib %}) is a default module and delivers the system views.
