# Modules Overview

The modules are the functional units of the web application and represent collections of views.

The Builder utilizes two types of modules:

* Regular modules&mdash;Regular modules allow you to add, modify, and delete them, and to add one or more views to them. For more information on how to handle the module settings, refer to the article on [designing the application]({% slug designingtheapp_kuib %}#toc-module-settings).
* Application Module&mdash;The Application Module is a default module and delivers the system views. For more information, refer to the article on the [Application Module]({% slug appmodule_kuib %}).
