# Styling & Themes Overview

Predefined




All available themes in the Builder are bundled and ready to use.

Kendo UI for jQuery, which delivers the widgets that are integrated with AngularJS, supports more themes than Kendo UI for Angular. To keep the parity between the two frameworks, the lacking themes for Angular were generated with the [Progress<sup>Â®</sup> Sass Theme Builder](http://themebuilder.telerik.com/). All themes for the Angular framework except for the Default Orange, Bootstrap v4, and Material (currently, in beta) were generated with the Theme Builder beforehand.

For more information on the themes that are supported by Kendo UI for jQuery, refer to the article on [Less-based]() and [SASS-based]() themes. For more information on the themes that are supported by Kendo UI for Angular, refer to the overview of [themes and styling]().
