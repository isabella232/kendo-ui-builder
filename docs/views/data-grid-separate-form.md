# Data Grid Separate Form View

The Data Grid Separate Form view is one of the built-in views that are provided by the Builder for facilitating common use-case scenarios.  

## Features

* Represents a Grid component with a data-driven form field. When the user makes a selection in the Grid, the form field updates accordingly.
* The ratio between the Grid and the form field is 1:1&mdash;when the Grid is open, the form field is hidden and vice versa.
* Supports CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) data operations.
* Supports form editing through the **Read-Only**, **Edit**, and **Read-Only-to-Editing** modes.
* Supports error handling.
* Allows you to set and edit its basic functionalities. For more information on the settings that are subject to modification, refer to the right-hand vertical toolbar (property grid) of the view.
* Through the **Settings** menu against each view in the view panel, you can edit the root properties of the view, as well as duplicate, move, and delete the view.
