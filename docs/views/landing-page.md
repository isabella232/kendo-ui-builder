# Landing Page View

The Landing Page view is one of the system views which the [Application Module]({% slug appmodule_kuib %}) provides by default.

## Features

* Represents the layout of the web page that will load when the user clicks on a search engine optimized search result or an online advertisement.
* Lists all modules inside its content.
* You can apply different styles for the view content by clicking on Edit CSS button and write your own custom styles in opened editor.

The view also includes the following custom sections where you can include your own HTML. Each section is identified in the view design page with a placeholder containing descriptive text:
* Custom top html section: Located in the area above the Content with modules list
* Custom bottom html section: Located in the area below the Content

The Designer automatically generates these files for you in application-folder\app\src\modules\application\landing-page. Add your custom HTML code to these files as required. The Edit option on each custom HTML section allows you to edit the corresponding file from within the Designer.
