# Expander

The Expander is part of the Navigation components which the Builder supports.

## Usage

* Represents a functional UI element.
* A collapsible container that when clicked, alternately expands to display, and collapses to hide its contents.
* Allows users to drag other components into its content following the [Blank view layout rules]({% slug blankview_kuib %}#toc-layout).
* To add contents, you drag at least one layout row to the expander, then drag additional components into that row, or into other rows that you have added.
