# Row

The Row is part of the Layout components which the Builder supports.

## Usage

* Represents a row element.
* Rows are used for building responsive layouts in [**Blank View**]({% slug blankview_kuib %}) and [**App Layout View**]({% slug applayout_kuib %})
* Allows configuration options such as adding, data managing, and deletion.
* Rows allow only **col** components to be dropped into them. Dragging any other component into a row automatically creates a column for it if you have not already dragged and dropped one.

## Properties of Interest
