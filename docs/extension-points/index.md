# Extension Points Overview

The extension points represent different means by which you can further customize the appearance and behavior of the generated application.

The options for customization include handling of events, extracting common logic in monolithic structures (such as your components and views), tweaking the layout and appearance, importing third-party libraries, and so on.

The available ways to customize the generated web application are:

* [Custom code]({% slug customcode_kuib %})
* [Custom templates]({% slug customtemplates_kuib %})
* [Custom styles]({% slug customstyles_kuib %})
* [Custom themes]({% slug customthemes_kuib %})
* [Extending package.json]({% slug extendingpackages_kuib %})
* [Extending .angular-cli.json (Angular only)]({% slug extendingangularcli_kuib %})
* [Extending the HTML head]({% slug extendinghead_kuib %})
