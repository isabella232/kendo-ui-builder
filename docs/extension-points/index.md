# Extension Points Overview

The extension points represent certain properties which allow you to customize the generated web application which has been created and generated with the Builder.

The available extension points for customizing the generated web application are:

* Code&mdash;You can set custom functions and apply custom event handling to the components.  
* Components&mdash;Depending on the framework you use, you can customize the behavior of the components by modifying specific exposed properties.  
* Head&mdash;You can enter custom scripts or links to the head of the generated project.
* Packages&mdash;You can edit the `package.json` file and customize the bundles and packages of the generated project.
* Styles&mdash;You can customize the styles of the generated web project by modifying the generated `.css` file.
* Themes&mdash;You can add themes that were generated with the Progress<sup>Â®</sup> Sass ThemeBuilder to the generated project.
* Views&mdash;Depending on the framework you use, you can modify the views of the generated project.
